# Modern Next 14 Server Side App with Server Actions, Infinite Scroll & Framer Motion Animations

Open code in VS (or choice of code editor) run command: npm run dev

The code should then run on local host 3000

Once you start scrolling you will immediately notice the infinate scrolling on the page with no repeat data; 
as well as the animation of the data loading in using "framer motion"!

All of the data is implimented using Next.js server side features (or server actions)

Note: You must have the most recent version of Next.js to run this application
