# Modern Next 14 Server Side App with Server Actions, Infinite Scroll & Framer Motion Animations

Open code in VS (or choice of code editor) run command: npm run dev

The code should then run on local host 3000

You will notice the animations loading in using "framer motion"!

All of the data is sourced via Next.js server side features (server actions)
